# Aim: To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns
# Algorithm: To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure
1. Query Decomposition
Break a complex request into smaller, manageable sub-questions or prompts.

Example Use – Article on AI in Healthcare:

❓ Main Prompt: “Write an article on the impact of AI in healthcare.”

🔄 Decomposed Prompts:

What are the main areas where AI is applied in healthcare?

What are the benefits and risks of using AI in diagnosis?

How does AI improve patient outcomes?

👉 Then combine responses into a well-structured article.

2. Decision-Making Prompts
Guide the model with explicit choices to shape the direction or tone of the content.

Example – Case Study Creation:

Prompt: “Generate a case study on a company using AI for supply chain management. Choose a real or fictional company. Should the case study be analytical or narrative-style?”

✅ This gives the model control options while ensuring structure.

3. Semantic Filtering
Use prompts that constrain outputs based on semantic requirements (e.g., tone, style, audience).

Example – Report Writing:

Prompt: “Write a formal report on climate change for policy makers. Use technical language and emphasize data.”

🧠 The model now filters informal content and adjusts the tone accordingly.

4. Few-Shot Prompting
Provide examples to guide the structure and tone of the response.

Example – Comic Book Script:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Prompt: “Write a comic book scene using this pattern:

Example:
Panel 1: [Setting]
Narration: [Context]
Character A: [Dialogue]

Now generate a scene with a superhero saving a train from crashing.”
🎭 This helps the model follow format and storytelling norms.

5. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Encourage the model to "think aloud" before generating content, improving coherence and logic.

Example – Analytical Article:
Prompt:
“Let’s break this down: First, define the concept of blockchain. Then explain its relevance in the finance industry. Finally, provide examples of its real-world use. Now write a cohesive article based on this structure.”

💡 Promotes logically ordered writing.

6. Instruction with Constraints
Clearly outline constraints like word count, reading level, or required sections.

Example – Academic Report:
Prompt:
“Write a 500-word academic report on quantum computing. Use APA format. Include an introduction, body with two subheadings, and a conclusion.”

📏 Helps enforce academic structure.

7. Reflective Prompting
Ask the model to critique or revise its own output.

Example:

Prompt: “Here is a draft of an article. Suggest three improvements and rewrite the introduction to be more engaging.”
# Result : The corresponding prompt executed successfully.
